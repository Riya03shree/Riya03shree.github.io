            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Now, you know little-bit about me. So, If you are interested about me and my life and especially my journey throughout, So don't skip a single line in this page.
            </p>

            <p>Born in Jharkhand and raised in Bihar, India. I went to school just like many. Throughout my education I always excelled in the artistic topics, from drawings, rangoli competition, painting competition to even in making things for science
                exibition. All these activities during my school days made my heart lean more towards creative-designing. Then,I realised that I really like these things and can make a career in this field. So,I started learning more in this field(working
                towards my goal)!
            </p>

            <p>In April 2020 I sarted a course offered by Harvard University-cs50 which helped me a lot in learning the kind of stuff I need to know! Then, During the month of May I came across the programs offered by Verzeo and I chose to continue my learning
                with them.After completing my course I have worked on a project with my alloted team and on completing that we got another three mini projects to do!On finishing all of the projects I joined another project-based program offered by Project-Mantra.Recently
                I'm working on the problem statement given by them.
